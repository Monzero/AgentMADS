When we began this \\njourney, the path forward was far \\nfrom clear. The landscape of our \\nindustry was rife with challenges, \\nas we faced intense competition \\namid adverse market conditions. \\nThere were internal challenges \\ntoo. However, one thing was \\nclear. We were ready to embrace \\nchange as a constant and would \\ncontinue to innovate, adapt, and \\ngrow together as a team. And \\nover the course of the last four \\ndecades, we did exactly that. Our \\nnever-ending thrust for continual \\nimprovement has become our \\nhallmark.\\nWhile our core philosophy of \\ncontinuous improvement and \\nhard work has brought us to \\nwhere we are today, we are aware \\nof the ever-evolving business \\nlandscape that requires us to \\nrapidly adapt – something we \\nhave always been adept at. \\nTechnological advancements are \\nbreaking down barriers. Artificial \\nintelligence is challenging \\nhuman intelligence. Customer \\naspirations are rising. Embracing \\nsustainability is becoming \\nessential for survival. Hence, \\ndecision-making must now be \\nboth fast and smart. This requires \\na novel way of working which \\nis what we have termed “Build \\nSmart”.\\nTo me, ‘being smart’ means \\nbeing able to think on one’s feet \\nand demonstrate the ability to \\napproach complex problems \\nwith creativity and speed. Our \\nphilosophy of “Build Smart”, \\nhowever, goes one step further - \\nwhere the culture of innovation \\nand continual improvement \\nis driven by a clear focus on \\nArtificial intelligence is \\nchallenging human intelligence. \\nCustomer aspirations are rising. \\nEmbracing sustainability is \\nbecoming essential for survival. \\nHence, decision-making must \\nnow be both fast and smart. \\nThis requires a novel way of \\nworking which is what we have \\ntermed “Build Smart”. \\nBuild Smart:  \\nCrafting Tomorrow, Today\\nMessage from \\nChairman\\ncustomer centricity and overall \\nsustainable value creation, \\nwhere the products have a high \\nsustainability footprint, where \\ncustomers are supported in \\nmaking the right choices, where \\nadvanced IT tools and systems \\nplay a key role in decision making \\nand where the entire work \\nculture is geared to make smart \\nchoices and contribute to the \\nnation’s growth.\\nWe have always believed that \\nwe can stay in the game if we \\nkeep our costs in check and keep \\ntrying novel solutions to build \\nunique competence, which give \\nus a sustainable and competitive \\nedge. Our drive to greening \\nour energy supply sources has \\nhelped us rationalise our costs \\nas well has helped us to score \\nan industry-leading mark of 56% \\ngreen share in overall electricity \\nconsumption. When we were \\nmandated to replace usage of \\ncoal in our grinding units in the \\nNCR area, the obvious choice \\nwas to opt for using natural gas. \\nOur team brainstormed and \\nfound agro-waste as an option. \\nNaturally, there were initial \\nhiccups which were soon ironed \\nout thanks to our collaborative \\nefforts and design thinking. The \\nteam then turned this into an \\nopportunity. Today, the majority \\nof our grinding units use agro-\\nwaste. This has not only proven \\nto be more economical but also \\nrepresents a small step from our \\nside towards addressing the issue \\nof stubble-burning. We have, in \\nfact, consumed 1.24 lac tonnes \\nof agro waste in the year 2023-\\n24. There are many more such \\ninitiatives which have helped us \\nin terms of better productivity, \\nefficiency, and cost optimisation, \\nwhile contributing to the overall \\ncause of sustainability. \\nOur customers are the key drivers \\nof our business and its growth, \\nand we rely on them for their \\ncontinual feedback so as to \\nstay up to date with their needs \\nand aspirations.

New start-ups and tech \\ncompanies are burning the \\nmidnight oil to work on newer \\nproducts and solutions to \\noutsmart each other. In the \\norganisational context, leaders \\nand employees are finding newer \\nways to build a competitive edge \\nover their peers and deliver high \\nperformance. Building a high \\nperforming organisation requires \\npeople who are talented, skilled, \\nand hard-working. However, \\nas the markets face greater \\nheadwinds today and more \\ncomplexity, hard work and talent \\nby themselves cannot lead to \\nsuccess. We must, therefore, \\nthink smart, and “Build Smart” \\n– a philosophy that underlies \\nall our current and upcoming \\nendeavours.\\nOver the years, our culture of \\ninnovation and spirit of continual \\nimprovement has enabled us \\nto deliver high performance. \\nHowever, given the reality of \\nintensifying competition, rising \\nconsolidation, and increasing \\nregulation, we have to build \\nsmarter and more efficient \\nstrategies to maintain our \\nstrong market position and \\nbrand equity.

Keeping this in view, a \\nnew premium offering “Bangur \\nMagna”, with superior quality \\nand distinct packaging, has also \\nbeen introduced by us. Our new \\nbrand strategy has helped us \\ncommunicate the value that we \\nbring to our customers in a much \\nstronger way. Our products are \\ngaining more visibility today and \\nwe are enjoying better brand \\nequity thanks to our “Build \\nSmart” strategy.\\nThe “Build Smart” way of \\nfunctioning can also help \\nus consolidate our standing \\nin terms of cost leadership. \\nAutomation presents a great \\nscope in enhancing our \\nmanufacturing excellence right \\nfrom Mining to Production and \\nPower operations to Logistics \\noperations. For example, with \\nthe integration of technology, \\nthe sampling operation \\nrequired for testing of quality \\nof input materials can easily be \\nautomated. This can make the \\nwhole testing process much \\nfaster and eliminate human \\nintervention which is prone \\nto bias. Similarly, technology-\\nbased solutions can greatly \\nstrengthen our logistics and \\nsales capabilities and meet \\ncustomers’ demand for high \\nservicing standards. Real-time \\nmonitoring of logistical metrics \\nby digitalising the transportation \\ncycle and GPS-enabled tracking \\ncan facilitate timely decision-\\nmaking and improve overall \\ncustomer-service. Likewise, \\nour dealers and other channel \\npartners, who play a major role \\nin our sales operations, can track \\nthe order status, position of \\ntarget achievement, outstanding, \\netc., on a real time basis with \\nthe help of a mobile-based app \\nsolution. These solutions offer \\ntransparency in our sales and \\ndistribution model while also \\nhelping us meet our customers’ \\nexpectations. We have \\nundertaken many such initiatives \\nduring this year. I am confident \\nthat they shall significantly boost \\nour business by helping with \\nprecise decision-making and \\nbuilding more transparent and \\nrobust systems.\\nOur “Build Smart” approach \\nalso draws attention to green \\nsolutions as we are cognisant \\nof the impact our operations \\nhave on our environment and \\nthe communities surrounding \\nour plants. Also, climate change \\nis a major risk to businesses the \\nworld over, and humanity at \\nlarge. It can be said that climate \\nchange today is our biggest \\nexistential threat.

Here, \\nMr. Akhoury delineates the \\ncompany’s plans to deliver on its \\nfuture-proof strategies and goals: \\nCan you provide an overview \\nof the company’s performance \\nover the past year?\\nOur performance in FY 2023-\\n24 has been exceptional to say \\nthe least. With 16% increase \\ncompared to the previous year, \\nwe achieved our highest-ever \\nturnover of ₹19,586 crore. Our \\nannual EBITDA also surged to \\nan all-time high of ₹4,925 crore \\nwith 46% increase. We registered \\nour best-ever sales volume of \\n35.5 million tonnes with 12% \\ngrowth. Our strong financial \\nperformance reflects our sharp \\nfocus on operational efficiencies. \\nThis is complemented by our \\ndigital transformation, which is \\ndriving us forward, streamlining \\nour operations, and empowering \\nour people with data-driven \\ndecision-making capabilities.\\nWhat are the main strategic \\npriorities for the company for \\nthe next three years?\\nOur immediate goal is to have \\n80+ million tonnes of cement \\nproduction capacity by 2028, \\nand we are relentlessly working \\nto make it a reality. Upon \\ncompletion of the ongoing \\ncement projects in different \\nstates, our production capacity \\nwill reach 72 million tonnes. \\nOur other strategic priorities \\ninclude increasing green power \\ngeneration, augmenting railway \\nconnectivity, improving the \\nthermal substitution rate, and \\nincreasing operational efficiency \\nthrough digitalisation and \\ntechnology adoption. We are \\nalso aggressively expanding our \\nfootprint in Ready-Mix Concrete \\nsegment with a goal to set up \\n~100 plants in the next three \\nyears in ~50 cities pan India.\\nYou have launched “Bangur” \\nas your master brand.  What \\nis its rationale and how is its \\nresponse in the market?\\nWhile we succeeded with our \\nthree brand strategy, given \\nour next wave of growth, there \\nwas a compelling need to \\ncreate a single unified brand \\nas a master brand. With our \\nrapidly increasing capacity, \\nthe idea was to build a distinct \\nand discernible brand identity \\nconnecting with consumer \\naspirations, that will help us \\nearn much greater recall value \\nand trust from our consumers, \\nand in turn will result in market \\nshare gains in the next 3-4 \\nyears.  Therefore, we decided \\nto launch “Bangur” as our \\nmaster brand in January 2024. \\nWe have positioned “Bangur” \\nas our umbrella brand while \\nmaintaining our existing three \\nbrands under its fold. The new \\nunified master brand has been \\nintroduced with a modern \\nvisual identity and digital scale-\\nup, with a reaffirmation of our \\nsustainable attributes. \\nIndependent homebuilders have \\nalways been our key customer \\nsegment.

This has \\nbeen implemented seamlessly \\nand in a record time. With SAP \\nintegration, digitalisation has \\npercolated to all areas of our \\noperations – right from raw \\nmaterial extraction to production \\nprocesses, and from logistics to \\nsales & marketing functions. \\nTo further enhance productivity \\nand efficiency in the sales \\ndomain, we have launched the \\nUdaanPRO and UdaanCONNECT \\napps for our sales and technical \\nservices teams as well as for \\nour channel partners. These \\napps facilitate real-time order \\nplacement, performance \\nmonitoring, tracking of \\noutstanding positions and \\nscheme participation, among \\nother features. In the logistics \\ndomain, we have kick-started a \\ncentralised platform – ‘Logistics \\nControl Tower’ – to provide real-\\ntime info on trucks and rakes, \\nenable meticulous planning, \\noptimising servicing of orders \\nfrom the least cost source, and \\nultimately improve customer \\nservice levels. These tools \\nwill help us grow our market \\nthrough better servicing of our \\nchannel partners and real-time \\ndata analysis of market trends.\\nFor the manufacturing domain, \\nwe have launched the Isaac \\nmobile application which is \\na digital tool to enable our \\npeople to carry out physical \\ninspections while walking \\naround in the plant to identify \\nareas for optimisation and \\nensure adherence to safety \\nand equipment performance. \\nThis will help us in the early \\nidentification of areas requiring \\nmaintenance, thereby improving \\nequipment uptime.  Additionally, \\nwe have also taken up several \\nother initiatives such as Unified \\nMonitoring of Raw Material \\nHandling Equipment, Robo \\nAnalysis, Privileged Access \\nManagement System (PAM), \\nreal-time monitoring through \\nSangam and SPLIV – all of which \\nhave boosted efficiency and \\nenabled more synergy in our \\nactivities.\\nWhat measures has the \\ncompany taken to reduce its \\nenvironmental impact and \\ncarbon footprint?\\nThe Cement industry is regarded \\nas a hard-to-abate sector in \\nterms of reducing its carbon \\nfootprint. In recent times, \\nthe industry is increasingly \\nwitnessing more stringent \\nenvironmental regulations and \\nneed for eco-friendly sustainable \\nproducts. We actively promote \\nsustainability as our core \\nbusiness strategy with a focus \\non the preservation of natural \\nresources and enhancing \\nresource use efficiency. I would \\nlike to highlight a few important \\nareas here:\\n•  Over the last few years, we \\nhave decided that we shall \\nnot add any new thermal \\npower capacity and would \\nprogressively reduce the \\nshare of existing thermal \\npower in our overall power \\nconsumption.

Indian Economy-Developments and Outlook\\n   The fiscal year 2023-24 for the Indian \\neconomy has been another year of stellar \\nperformance. Indian economy is estimated \\nto achieve a robust growth of 7.6% during \\nFY 2023-24 over and above 7.0% and \\n9.1% growth rate realized in FY 2022-23 \\nand FY 2021-22 respectively. Considering \\ngeopolitical headwinds, high interest \\nrates and volatile commodity prices, the \\neconomic performance is considered \\ncommendable. Today, India is reckoned \\nas one of the best performing economies \\nreflecting its bright economic stature in the \\nglobal economic landscape.\\n   The continued buoyancy in the economy \\nis driven by high domestic demand, rising \\ngovernment capital expenditure, supportive \\npolicy environment and healthy investment \\nflows. The strong economic performance \\nand macroeconomic stability has also led \\nto buoyancy in tax collections resulting \\nin more room for Government to spend \\nmoney on development activities (India’s \\nnet direct tax collections for FY 2023-24 \\nsaw a 17.7% rise). Overall, the economy is \\nwitnessing high levels of business and \\nconsumer confidence.\\n   The manufacturing sector registered \\ndouble-digit growth in FY24 driven \\nby a surge in investment, improved \\ninvestor confidence and strong domestic \\ndemand conditions. The strength of the \\nmanufacturing sector is also underscored \\nby the India manufacturing PMI \\n(Purchasing Managers’ Index), which in \\nMarch 2024 rose to 59.1, the highest level \\nsince February 2008. \\n   Due to conducive economic policies, \\nlarger macroeconomic stability, continued \\npush for reforms and stable government, \\nthere has been immense improvement \\nin credibility of India’s economy, driving \\nforeign investment in the country. \\nFurther, a notable development regarding \\nthe expected addition of the country’s \\nsovereign bonds to global bond indexes in \\n2024-25 shall help boost liquidity, contain'),\n",

Cement Industry – Development and Outlook\\n    During the year 2023-24, cement demand \\nis estimated to have grown at a robust \\n10-12% to 442-447 Mn tonnes. This is after \\nregistering a healthy ~12% growth in the \\nyear 2022-23. Favorable demand conditions \\nhelped utilization levels inch up to 71-73%, \\nafter having touched to ~69% in FY23. \\nThe solid growth witnessed over the last \\ntwo years is directly attributable to the \\ngovernment’s thrust to boost infrastructure \\ndevelopment, rapid urbanization and \\noverall buoyant housing demand. General \\nElections ensured that the thrust to achieve \\nset targets under Government Housing \\nSchemes are achieved, especially in rural \\nhousing segment, which witnessed strong \\ndemand from “Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \\n– Gramin”. \\n    Consistent favorable demand conditions \\nand push to gain market share have \\ntriggered a wave of capacity addition \\nannouncements by the cement \\nmanufactures. In FY24, industry is \\nestimated to have added ~45 MTPA of new \\ncement capacity taking the overall installed \\ncapacity to ~641 MT.\\n    Cement industry has benefited during FY24 \\nwith easing input costs. International coal \\n/ imported prices, which had witnessed \\na sharp rise during FY23 dropped during \\nthe year. As a result, the power & fuel cost, \\nwhich forms a sizable cost of the cement \\nindustry also witnessed declining trend. \\nCoupled with this, the positive operating \\nleverage helped industry improve operating \\nmargins during the year.\\n   Going into FY 2024-25, the demand outlook \\nfor cement industry continues to be \\nstrong as structurally all demand drivers \\nviz. infra, housing, and private capex show \\npositive direction. Growth in Infrastructure \\ndevelopment spending is expected to \\ncontinue with government focusing on its \\nflagship schemes, such as PM Gati Shakti, \\nNational Infrastructure Pipeline and rising \\ninvestments in roads, railways, metros, \\nairports, and irrigation projects. This will \\ncontinue to drive healthy infrastructure-led \\ndemand growth. Government Impetus to \\nPLI scheme and Atmanirbhar Bharat, focus \\non multimodal logistics, warehousing, etc. \\nare expected to support demand from \\nthe industrial segment. On the housing \\ndemand, the entire real estate sector is \\nwitnessing a demand revival. This apart, \\nGovernment focus on housing for all \\nand increasing outlays for PMAY scheme \\nindicates strong demand growth for \\ncement from housing segment.

Statement by director responsible \\nfor the business responsibility \\nreport, highlighting ESG \\nrelated challenges, targets and \\nachievements (listed entity \\nhas flexibility regarding the \\nplacement of this disclosure)\\nDear stakeholders,\\nAt Shree Cement, we believe that ambition and innovation, bolstered by design \\nthinking and collaborative efforts, are crucial to efficient business growth. \\nThis year, our motto is to ‘Build Smart’, a philosophy that will help build stronger, \\nmore durable, and environmentally responsible infrastructure. This philosophy \\ncombines the core elements of efficient manufacturing, data-driven decision-\\nmaking, emerging technology, best-in-class people and processes, customer-\\ncentricity and sustainable business practices. Weaving the ideology of ‘Build Smart’ \\ninto the fabric of our revamped brand identity ‘Bangur Cement’, we have embarked \\non a journey of redefining excellence while continuing to deliver protection, strength \\nand durability.\\nWe keep ourselves up to date on the latest industry trends, cross-sectoral \\ndevelopments, and emerging technologies to ensure we retain our position as an \\nindustry torchbearer. In March 2024, for instance, we entered the ready-mix concrete \\n(RMC) segment with the commissioning of our first greenfield unit in Hyderabad. \\nThe new RMC plant is key to our evolution as a multi-product player in the cement \\nindustry.\\nWe have been consistent in our capacity expansion (primarily via organic pathways), \\nwith a capacity CAGR of about 12% over FY2014-24. Given our outlook for cement \\ndemand remaining high, we plan to increase our grinding capacity organically at a \\nsimilar CAGR over FY24-27. Most of the expansions, however, will focus on existing \\nmarkets, even though we have made progress in expanding our footprint to new \\nregions such as Andhra Pradesh. By 2028, we are targeting more than 80 MTPA \\ncapacity by which time, 13 more our plants will be in operation.\\nOver the past year, we have ramped up our capacity utilization, raised cost efficiency, \\nenhanced our R&D efforts, and also built on brand equity. Thus, we are ensuring that \\nwe take complete advantage of the market tailwinds to tap into previously uncharted \\nterritory and thereby create new opportunities also within the market. After all, \\ncollaboration and community are the hallmark of growth and progress – and in this \\nvein, we hope to be able to create greater employment opportunities for people \\nacross India and contribute to the nation’s growth story. \\nLooking forward to continued success through collective growth!\\n8.

Contingent assets are not \\nrecognized. \\np) Leases\\n  At the commencement of a lease, the \\nCompany recognises a right of use asset and a \\nlease liability with respect to lease agreements \\nin which it is the lessee. \\n  The lease liability is measured at the present \\nvalue of the lease payments that are not paid \\nat the commencement date of the lease. The \\nlease payments are discounted using the \\ninterest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can \\nbe readily determined otherwise incremental \\nborrowing rate is used to discount the lease \\npayments.

The right of use \\nassets is subsequently measured at cost less \\naccumulated depreciation/ amortisation, \\naccumulated impairment losses, if any. Right \\nof use assets are depreciated/ amortised on \\nstraight line basis over the shorter period of \\nlease term and useful life of the underlying \\nasset.\\n  For a lease modification that is not accounted \\nas a separate lease, the Company re-measure \\nthe lease liability by discounting the revised \\nlease payments using revised discount rate, \\nwith corresponding adjustment to the ‘right of \\nuse asset’. The Company recognize gain or loss \\nin the statement of profit and loss for partial or \\nfull termination of lease for lease modifications \\nthat decrease the scope of the lease.\\n  The right of use assets and lease liability is \\npresented separately on the face of the Balance \\nsheet as ‘Right of Use Assets’ and ‘Lease \\nLiabilities’ respectively.\\nq) Business Combination\\n  The Company applies the acquisition method \\nin accounting for business combinations. The \\nconsideration transferred by the Company to \\nobtain control of a business is calculated as \\nthe sum of the fair values of assets transferred, \\nliabilities incurred and assumed and the equity \\ninterests issued by the Company as at the \\nacquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains \\ncontrol of the acquiree which includes the \\nfair value of any asset or liability arising from \\na contingent consideration arrangement.'),\n",

The Company recognizes a loss \\nallowance for expected credit losses on \\nfinancial asset. In case of trade receivables, \\nthe Company follows the simplified \\napproach permitted by Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments for recognition of \\nimpairment loss allowance. The application \\nof simplified approach does not require \\nthe Company to track changes in credit \\nrisk.

In assessing value \\nin use, the estimated future cash flows are \\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-\\ntax discount rate that reflects current market \\nassessments of the time value of money and \\nthe risks specific to the asset. In determining \\nfair value less cost of disposal, recent market \\ntransactions are taken into account. If no such \\ntransactions can be identified, an appropriate \\nvaluation model is used. When it is not possible \\nto estimate the recoverable amount of an \\nindividual asset, the Company estimates the \\nrecoverable amount of cash generating unit \\n(CGU) to which the asset belongs. The cash \\ngenerating unit is the smallest identifiable \\ngroup of assets that generates cash inflows that \\nare largely independent of cash inflows of other \\nassets or group of assets.\\n   A previously recognized impairment loss is \\nfurther provided or reversed depending on \\nchanges in circumstances.\\n   Where an impairment loss subsequently \\nreverses, the carrying amount of the asset \\nis increased to the revised estimate of its \\nrecoverable amount, but so that the increased \\ncarrying amount does not exceed the carrying \\namount that would have been determined had \\nno impairment loss been recognized for the \\nasset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment \\nloss is recognized as income immediately.\\ng) Revenue Recognition\\n   Revenue is recognized to depict the \\ntransfer of promised products or services to \\ncustomers. Revenue is measured based on the \\nconsideration to which the Company expects \\nto be entitled in a contract with a customer and \\nexcludes amount collected on behalf of third \\nparty. \\n   Revenue from sale of products is recognized \\nwhen products are delivered to the customers. \\nDelivery occurs when the product has \\nbeen shipped to the customers, the risks of \\nobsolescence and loss have been transferred \\nto customers and either the customer has \\naccepted the products in accordance with \\nsales arrangement. Revenue is disclosed net of \\nGoods and Service Tax (GST), discounts, volume \\nrebates and returns, as applicable. \\nh)  Dividend income is recognized when the right'),\n",

In case of a bargain \\npurchase, before recognizing a gain in \\nrespect thereof, the Company determines \\nwhether there exists clear evidence of the \\nunderlying reasons for classifying the business \\ncombination as a bargain purchase thereafter, \\nthe  Company reassesses whether it has \\ncorrectly identified all the assets acquired \\nand liabilities assumed and recognizes any \\nadditional assets or liabilities that are so \\nidentified, any gain thereafter is recognized \\nin OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital \\nReserve.

The Company recognizes a loss \\nallowance for expected credit losses on \\nfinancial asset. In case of trade receivables, \\nthe Company follows the simplified \\napproach permitted by Ind AS 109 – \\nFinancial Instruments for recognition of \\nimpairment loss allowance. The application \\nof simplified approach does not require \\nthe Company to track changes in credit \\nrisk. The Company calculates the expected \\ncredit losses on trade receivables using a \\nprovision matrix on the basis of its historical \\ncredit loss experience. \\n 2) Financial Liabilities\\n  Initial Recognition and Measurement\\n   Financial liabilities are classified, at initial \\nrecognition, as financial liabilities at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss, loans and \\nborrowings or payables or as derivative \\ndesignated as hedging instruments in an \\neffective hedge, as appropriate.\\n   All financial liabilities are recognized initially \\nat fair value and, in the case of loans and'),\n",

Although these \\nestimates are based upon management’s \\nbest knowledge of current events and actions, \\nactual results could differ from these estimates. \\nThese estimates are reviewed regularly and any \\nchange in estimates are adjusted prospectively. \\n  In the process of applying the Company’s \\naccounting policies, management has made \\nthe following estimates, assumptions and \\njudgements, which have significant effect \\non the amounts recognized in the financial \\nstatements:\\n a) Deferred Tax Assets\\n   The recognition of deferred tax assets \\nrequires assessment of whether it is \\nprobable that sufficient future taxable profit \\nwill be available against which deferred tax \\nasset can be utilized.  The Company reviews \\nat each balance sheet date the carrying \\namount of deferred tax assets.\\n b)  Property, Plant and Equipment & \\nIntangible Assets\\n   The determination of depreciation and \\namortization charge depends on the useful \\nlives for which judgements and estimations \\nare required.

Market risk comprises of currency rate risk, interest rate risk and commodity \\nprice risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, \\ninvestments and derivative financial instruments. Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or \\nfuture cash flows of financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate \\nbecause of changes in market interest rates. This is based on the financial assets and liabilities held as at \\n31.03.2024 and 31.03.2023.\\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movement in market variables on the carrying value of post-\\nemployment benefit obligations, provisions and on non- financial assets and liabilities. The sensitivity of \\nthe relevant statement of profit and loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market \\nrates. The Company’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risk including the effect of changes in \\nforeign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments \\nsuch as foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currency and interest rate swaps of varying maturity \\ndepending upon the underlying contract and risk management strategy to manage its exposures to \\nforeign exchange fluctuations and interest rates.   \\nInterest Rate Risk and Sensitivity\\nThe Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the long term \\ndebt obligations with floating interest rates. \\nThe Company’s policy is to manage its floating interest rate on foreign currency loans and borrowings by \\nentering into interest rate swaps, in which the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the \\ndifference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon \\nprincipal amount. Hence, the Company is not exposed for any interest rate risk due to foreign currency \\ndenominated floating interest rate as on 31.03.2024 and 31.03.2023. Following is the interest rate sensitivity \\nfor unhedged exposure of Indian Rupee denominated floating interest rate borrowing:\\nNOTE 49 - FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTD.)\\n(₹ in Crore)\\nParticulars For the year ended \\n31.03.2024\\nFor the year ended \\n31.03.2023\\nImpact on profit before tax due to increase in 50 basis points (0.27) (2.45)\\nImpact on profit before tax due to decrease in 50 basis points 0.27 2.45\\nForeign Currency Risk and Sensitivity \\nThe Company has obtained foreign currency loans and has foreign currency payables for supply of fuel, \\nraw material and equipment and is therefore, exposed to foreign exchange risk. The Company uses cross \\ncurrency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts to eliminate the currency exposures. \\nThe impact on profit before tax is due to change in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities including \\nnon- designated foreign currency derivative.\\nThe following tables demonstrate the sensitivity in the USD, EURO, GBP and AED to the Indian Rupee with \\nall other variable held constant.\\nFor the Year ended 31.03.2024\\nParticulars\\nEffect on Profit Before Tax (₹ in crore)\\nUSD GBP EURO'),\n",

Since I don't have specific information on that right now, maybe it doesn't matter much because companies usually report their financials annually regardless of the specific year.\n",

They probably have an annual report where they detail their revenues and other financial metrics. The user mentioned using the AnnualReportSearch tool, which I think can help me find this information if it's available within the company's own annual report.\n",

      "So, maybe I should start by searching the Shree Cement annual report for key figures like revenue, net profit, and other revenue streams such as cement sales or raw material exports. If that data isn't available in their internal report, perhaps I can look it up on a reliable financial website or business news portal where companies often post their financial summaries.\n",

      "\n",

      "1. **Access Shree Cement's Annual Report:** Use the AnnualReportSearch tool to search for key financial figures such as revenue, net profit, and specific revenue streams like cement sales or raw material exports.\n",
