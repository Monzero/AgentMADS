      "*   **Defining critical and non-critical suppliers:** The company categorizes suppliers based on factors such as volume of procurement, substitutability, and other parameters.\n",
      "*   **Supplier assessments:**  The company carries out assessments of suppliers using its assessment framework, integrating the results into the onboarding process. This considers the location and vulnerability of the supplier.\n",

The policy does, however, indicate that the company expects its suppliers to follow the Supplier Code of Conduct (available as an annexure). This code details expectations regarding human rights, health & safety, ethics & integrity, environmental impact, and product quality.  The company also has mechanisms for addressing violations and non-compliance.\n",
