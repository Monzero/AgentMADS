If the reppointment date is either not provided or older than 5 years (i.e some date before 2019), then you need to check appointment date. If appointment date is also older than 5 years (i.e before 2019), mark that board member as permanent. Give list of board members and whether or not they are permanent. In other words, either of appointment date or reappointment date should be within last 5 years. For example, if a board member has appoinment date '02-07-2020' and reappointment date is not present, then because the appointment date is within last 5 years  (i.e March 2020 to March 2025 assuming we are checking for annual report as of 31st March 2025) then we would label them as 'Not permanent'. Second example, if any board member has appointment date as 01-01-2012 and reappointment date not present, then we would mark them permanent"
